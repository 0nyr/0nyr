### Hello World

My friends call me **Onyr** even if my real name is Florian Rascoussier. 

I'm a 23 years old and 4th year CS student at INSA Lyon, France. I love to make things and create stuff as a programming enthusiast. My main center of interests aside from code are art, science and philosophy. I also enjoy doing sports like running, hiking and archery. I'm involved in several associations like [Kryptosphere](https://kryptosphere.org/en/).
