### Hello World

Welcome code traveler ! Here you can behold many of my project.

  <summary>Bio</summary>
My friends call me **Onyr** even if my real name is Florian Rascoussier.
  
I'm a 23 years old and 4th year CS student at INSA Lyon, France. I love to make things and work on personal projects as a programming enthusiast. Since I started coding in my childhood making text-based RPGs in Basic-Casio on my calculator, my deep love of code craftmanship has only been growing stronger with the years. On this journey, I have also met so many generous and talented people, some of them now being friends, that I now consider programming as a way of life. My other main centers of interests aside from code are art, science and philosophy. I also enjoy doing sports like running, hiking and archery. I'm involved in several associations like [Kryptosphere](https://kryptosphere.org/en/).
  
Besides, I'm a fervent Linux daily user, Open Source advocate and crypto curious.

- üç™ Fun fact: I'm secretly planning to break the world record for the biggest cooky ever made, currently set at about [18 tons with a diameter of more that 30m](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-biscuit-cookie/)... Web browser not included.
